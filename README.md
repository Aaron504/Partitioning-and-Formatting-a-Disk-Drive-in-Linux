# Partitioning and Formatting a Disk Drive in Linux


 

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, you'll learn how to partition and format a disk drive in Linux. Knowing how to do this is a critical skill to have as an IT Support Specialist. Partitions are important because a file system can't function without one. When you acquire a new disk drive, at least one partition is required in order to be able to write files to the file system. Different partitions can then have different file formats, depending on their purpose.
